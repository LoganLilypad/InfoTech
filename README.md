KCTC's IT Discord bot \*woo\*

Mainly designed for studying for the class, also comes with a few fun commands.

Because I don't currently dont use the bot, updates will be made rarely so feel free to make any changes to the bot (adding commands, questions, etc.).

Invite the bot to your own server via this link:
